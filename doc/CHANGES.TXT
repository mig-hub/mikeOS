  mode (9600 baud as before), or 1 for a new slow mode (1200 baud)

# New SERIAL command in BASIC: "SERIAL ON 1200" or "SERIAL ON 9600"
  to enable, "SERIAL SEND X" or "SERIAL SEND 50" to send a byte,
  and "SERIAL REC X" to receive a byte into a variable

# New PORT command in BASIC: "PORT OUT 1234 X" or "PORT OUT 1234 20"
  to send byte to a port, and "PORT IN 1234 X" to receive a byte

----------------------

# MikeOS BASIC included in the kernel; run EXAMPLE.BAS to try
  it out, and see doc/handbook-appdev-basic.html for a guide

  AX = tenths of a second to wait (so eg AX = 30 = 3 seconds)

# programs/hello.asm and programs/gfxdemo.asm removed (and their binaries
  on the floppy) -- old and not useful now

  kernel disk operations; then 32K for external programs

# Major code simplification and cleanup: removed mouse support,
  DOS support, STAKAN.BIN, testzone, CLI PROMPT command; many of these
  features will continue to be developed in the TomOS project

# Source code restructured: bootloader moved to source/bootload;
  system calls now separated into multiple files in source/features/;
  os_main.asm renamed kernel.asm; kernel file is now KERNEL.BIN

# More code cleanup work: use 'mov ax, 0' instead of 'xor ax, ax' and
  'mov si, foo' instead of 'lea si, [foo]'; more comments; instances of
  8 spaces changed to tabs; hex notation now always uses 'h' suffix
  (eg always '10h' and never '0x10') for consistency

# Certain disk routines for manipulating the FAT and root directory have
  been made internal to source/features/disk.asm, and not accessible to
  user programs, to simplify the disk API

# New system call: os_string_parse takes a string pointer in SI and
  breaks it into zero-terminated smaller string pieces based on spaces;
  eg SI = 'Foo bar baz stuff' returns AX = 'Foo', BX = 'bar',
  CX = 'baz', DX = 'stuff'

# New system call: os_string_to_int takes a decimal string (max '65535')
  in SI and returns the numerical value in AX

# File manager (FILEMAN.BIN) can now copy files (up to 28K in size), using
  external program RAM -- first 4K is reserved for the file manager itself

# os_get_file_list now returns sanitised comma-separated list of files
  (eg "FOO.BIN,HELLO.TXT" instead of "FOO     BIN,HELLO   TXT" etc.)

# dosbuild.bat renamed build-win.bat -- it now adds boot block and programs
  to mikeos.flp using third-party tools

# os_list_dialog rewritten: now shows selected option as a black bar,
  rather than with ">>>>>" indicator

# MONITOR.BIN updated for new memory map; now runs code ORGed at 36864

# When exiting a program that was launched from the menu-driven app selector,
  the "Program finished" message now appears in a red bar at the bottom

# Text with bright attributes should no longer blink on the screen

# FILEMAN.BIN now refuses to rename a file to an existing filename

# build-linux.sh script now creates disk_images/mikeos.flp if that
  file cannot be found

  calls to create an empty file, save data from RAM to a file, remove a
  file, rename a file and more -- see source/fat12_write.asm

# New file manager: programs/fileman.asm -- lets you delete and rename
  files, and get information on the floppy fisk

# Mouse driver from Tomasz Gorol, with system calls in
  source/os_mouse_syscalls.asm and documentation in the doc/ directory;
  also MOUSETST.BIN program to demonstrate it

# New system call: os_filename_convert -- takes a normal filename such
  as 'FOO.BIN' and converts it into the FAT12 equivalent of 'FOO     BIN'
  (first part padded out with spaces to 8 chars, no full-stop separator)

# New system call: os_list_dialog -- takes a comma-separated and
  zero-terminated string, and shows options in a list box

# New system call: os_input_dialog -- pops up a small box with
  a message, and prompts user to enter a string

# PCXVIEW.BIN refuses to display files without a .PCX extension

# TEST.PCX is now in programs/ and copied to floppy disk when
  build-linux.sh, build-openbsd.sh or build-osx.sh is run

# os_draw_background doesn't clear screen at start, to cut down on flicker

# At kernel start, don't try to set up a block cursor (it's not useful)

# build-linux.sh now includes a method for blanking FAT12 floppies at the
  top of the code, in the comments

# In programs/mikedev.inc, os_string_uppercase and os_string_lowercase
  were marked incorrectly as using SI rather than AX -- fixed

# Added -w+orphan-labels to NASM calls in build-linux.sh, and fixed labels
  without colons throughout OS and programs

# Un-needed commented-out lines removed from programs/keyboard.asm

# In source/bootload.asm, comments referred to first two bytes of FAT;
  really means first two clusters -- now fixed

# os_int_to_string updated -- now based on a public domain routine
  that handles full 16-bit registers

# CLI now strips spaces with os_string_chomp before checking for blank
  lines -- stops it complaining that ' ' (space) is not a valid program

# os_string_strip and show_files now use os_buffer as a temporary store,
  rather than their own strings (reduces kernel size by 512 bytes)

# os_input_string fixed so that backspaced chars are zeroed-out

# os_int_reboot internal call added, which reboots the machine
  via the keyboard controller

# Removed 'API version' from start of os_main.asm; kernel code now
  starts at 8000h (bootloader updated accordingly)

# Added os_get_api_version which returns the current API version,
  as defined at the top of os_main.asm, in AL

# Removed CLI_VER from os_cli.asm -- it's not going to be updated
  outside of MikeOS so a single global version number is simpler

# Changed 'REBOOT' to 'EXIT' in os_cli.asm -- now it doesn't
  reboot but exits cleanly with a 'ret'

# CREDITS.TXT added to list people involved in the project



0.40 (16th January 2007)
------------------------

CHANGES BY PETER NEMETH:

# os_syscalls.asm renamed to syscalls.asm, to support the DOS 8.3
  filename character format (NASM could not find certain files)

# BUILD.BAT added for DOS users

# Divide by zero handling (int 0h) added

# Drive descriptor fixed in bootsector and some features added;
  now it will not hang the system if there is a boot failure

# Before loading a DOS program, save and clean up registers

# DOS exit call fixed: does not restart the OS, and programs
  can exit with error codes

# DOS 'get date' interrupt added; now returns the current date

# Some rets replaced with irets

# DOS Ctrl+Break handler added; not yet working (IRQ 9 doesn't
  call int 1Bh)

# DOS print character via printer added

# Some helper routines added for DOS

# DOS CP/M compatible routines added

# DOS reset disk added

# DOS set/get current drive added

# DOS set date function added

# DOS set/get time function added

# DOS functions sorted by function number

# DOS unimplemented interrupt call fixed; now only exits from
  program and display message, not restart OS

# DOS serial port and modem support interrupt added;
  read and write from STDAUX (COM1)

# DOS interrupt flush buffer and read fixed; now really flush the
  buffer before read


CHANGES BY MIKE SAUNDERS:

# gfxdemo.asm fixed to quit properly

# DOS set vector routine added

# Added mini Program Segment Prefix block to os_app_data in
  os_main.asm -- needs to be done properly, but VisiCalc
  now starts up



0.30 (12th November 2006)
-------------------------

# New command line interface mode, currently featuring DIR, HELP,
  CLS, PROMPT, VER and EXIT inbuilt commands

# os_alert_dialog renamed os_dialog_box due to new feature: multiple
  button support. If DX = 1 when called, it presents two buttons
  (OK and Cancel) with the selection returned in AX

# New system call: os_string_compare -- takes two strings and sets
  the carry flag if they're the same

# New system call: os_string_chomp -- removes trailing spaces
  at the end of a string

# New system call: os_string_strip -- removes character specified
  in AX from the string in SI

# Kernel source split into multiple files for easier editing, based
  around os_main.asm which includes the rest. These kernel files
  are now in kernel/, with the bootloader in bootloader/

# os_program_load now sets carry flag if program not found, instead
  of bailing out to os_fatal_error, and also returns from a call

# os_program_load can clear the screen before loading a program if
  BX = 1. Useful for the file selector dialog

# Changed os_pause to use BIOS call

# Fixed zero-termination bug in os_string_copy

# MikeOS programs that include mikedev.inc can now access the
  8K scratchpad buffer via os_buffer

# Moved DOSTEST.ASM, for testing DOS compatibility, into the
  programs/ directory (so that it's automatically built)

# Bootloader now has error messages, rather than just freezing

# Split up the assemble and disk-image scripts to avoid loopback
  mounting errors, and simplify editing

# Various small cleanups and fixes



0.25 (27th October 2006)
------------------------

# New system call: os_modify_int_handler

# Removed DOS compatibility interrupt handlers from bootloader,
  replaced with code in kernel using os_modify_int_handler

# System call for os_get_file_list routine added

# Music keyboard demo app no longer uses 100% CPU
